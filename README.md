# EcoHacK - 2023

The second edition of EcoHacK will take place at the University of Stirling (Campus Central), 09-11 October 2023.

With the advent of low-cost passive detectors and the recent development of new acoustic sampling methods, the collection of ecological sounds in the field has gained momentum amongst researchers and practitioners worldwide to answer key ecological questions. The analysis of sound recordings was traditionally done manually but quickly became a time-consuming process. To overcome this issue, acoustic indices have recently been developed to summarize the sonic environment. Furthermore, the use of sound recognition algorithms based on machine learning now allows to discriminate with high confidence specific sounds of interest. As these modern techniques are evolving rapidly, this workshop will provide an opportunity to work collaboratively on projects (close to hackathon format), learn, discuss, and exchange on state of the art methods in eco-acoustics.

The main objectives of EcoHacK are to:

- bring together students, early-career, postdoctoral and senior researchers as well as key stakeholders (e.g. charities and private sector bodies) interested in sound recognition, bio/eco acoustic, and soundscape ecology,

* foster links and collaboration between institutions and across disciplines, as well as encouraging dialogue between the academic and private sector,

+ discuss, exchange, and share experiences and best practices in sound recording analysis,

- explore novel ways of linking acoustic data with environmental variables at different spatiotemporal scales.


## Important information

**Register here before Sept. 30th 2023**.
Seats will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis due to the limited capacity (max 25 people). 

## Participating to EcoHacK

There are two ways to participate to EcoHacK :

* Propose a project idea at registration (see examples from last year [here](https://github.com/brain-bzh/EcoHacK-2022)) and find your teammates during Day 1.

* Join a project during Day 1.

All projects will be introduced during the “Project Pitch” session during Day 1, and on the afternoon on Day 3, all projects will present the work done during EcoHacK. Moreover, there will be opportunities to talk about any bio/ecoacoustic-related topics during **Blitz talks** and a **poster session**.

**Feel free to propose your own idea!** All confirmed projects are listed below. 

Examples of projects / themes :

- Using ecoacoustic indices to characterize biodiversity in field recordings

- Machine learning datasets and models for species identification using sound

## Local organizing committee

- Dr Jeremy Froidevaux, University of Stirling, UK. Jeremy is a Leverhulme early-career research fellow at the University of Stirling, Scotland. He is a conservation biologist with broad interests in wildlife ecology and conservation. Using emergent bioacoustic methods, his research focuses on assessing the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity, especially bats, birds, and recently bees.

- Dr Nicolas Farrugia, IMT Atlantique, France. Nicolas is an assistant professor at IMT Atlantique, an elite technical university in France. His research interests include developing innovative methods to better understand Sounds and the Brain using modern machine learning and deep learning.

- Dr Tom Bradfer-Lawrence, RSPB, UK. Tom is a Senior Conservation Scientist at RSPB. He is a landscape ecologist, interested in the conservation of biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. His work includes community ecology, ecoacoustics, and nature-based solutions to climate change.
